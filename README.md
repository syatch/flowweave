# FlowWeave
YAML-based workflow runner for task orchestration

Although this version is more stable, it takes a few seconds to start up.

Therefore, [Lite version](https://github.com/syatch/flowweave-lite) is recommended.

This project is in early development.

## Installation

Install FlowWeave using pip:

```bash
pip install flowweave
```

# FlowWeave Getting Started Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide to getting started with FlowWeave.

## 1. Installation

Install FlowWeave using pip:

```bash
pip install flowweave
```

## 2. Prepare YAML Flow Definition

Create a YAML file defining your flow and stages. Example `my_flow.yml`:

```yaml
global_option:
  debug:
    - true
    - false

default_option:
  retries: 1
  timeout: 300

flow:
  - stage1
  - stage2

stage:
  stage1:
    task1:
      op: my_task
      option:
        path: ./data
      chain:
        part: head
        next: task2
    task2:
      op: my_task
      option:
        path: ./output
      chain:
        part: tail
  stage2:
    task3:
      op: my_task
      option:
        path: ./other
      chain:
        part: head
```
```

## 3. Implement Tasks / Operators

Create task scripts following the FlowWeave task structure. Example `task/my_task.py`:

```python
from flowweave import FlowWeaveTask, FlowWeaveTaskRunner, Result

class MyTaskRunner(FlowWeaveTaskRunner):
    def __init__(self):
        self.path = ""

    def __call__(self):
        print(f"Processing: {self.path}")
        return Result.SUCCESS

class Task(FlowWeaveTask):
    runner = MyTaskRunner
```

## 4. Run the Flow

Use the FlowWeave `run` method:

```python
from flowweave import FlowWeave

FlowWeave.run("my_flow.yml", parallel=False, show_log=True)
```

- `parallel=True` enables parallel execution of global option combinations.
- `show_log=True` prints detailed task and stage logs.

## 5. Notes

- Tasks can have dependencies via `chain.next`.
- Options are merged from `default_option`, `global_option`, and task-specific options.
- Retry and timeout can be configured per task (refer to FlowWeave documentation).

# FlowWeave Flow Execution Overview

This document explains how FlowWeave executes tasks and stages.

## 1. Stage Execution

- Stages are executed sequentially in the order listed in `flow`.
- Each stage can contain multiple tasks.
- Tasks within a stage follow the `chain` dependency.

## 2. Task Execution

- Each task is submitted via Prefect `@task`.
- If a task has a dependency (`chain.next`), it waits for the previous task.
- Options are merged from default, global, and task-specific settings.

## 3. Result Propagation

- Each task returns a dictionary: `{"name": ..., "option": ..., "result": ...}`
- Stage result is `FAIL` if any task fails.
- Flow result is `FAIL` if any stage fails.

## 4. Parallel Execution

- FlowWeave can run multiple global option combinations in parallel using Prefect `flow.submit`.
- Within a stage, tasks remain sequential.
- `prev_future` ensures tasks respect dependencies.

## 5. Logging Control

- `show_log = False` disables logging via `get_run_logger().disabled`.
- Can be set at flow or task level.
